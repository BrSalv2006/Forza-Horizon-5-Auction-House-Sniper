# Forza Horizon 5 Auction House Sniper

Please be aware that this bot does not place bids on cars in the auction house; instead, it attempts to buy them outright. Additionally, the bot does not guarantee the successful purchase of a car from the auction house or a successful buyout. Its purpose is simply to help you try and snipe cars while you are away from your computer.

**To stop the program, you can either close the console window or terminate the process through Task Manager.**

**The program will continuously snipe cars for you, allowing you to leave it running overnight and potentially return to multiple successful purchases.**

**The program will only function with a 16:9 screen resolution and requires a minimum of 60 FPS, along with default brightness and HUD scaling settings.**

**The entire program is written in Python, so you’ll need to install Python and the necessary libraries if you haven’t already.**

To install the required libraries, run the following command in the console:  

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Before launching the script you need to setup a few things, don't worry this isnt anything substantial, but you will need to do this each time you run the program.

Step 1:
  ![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fbff664-dfab-4896-8f5d-d6c2bbab8ffb)

  Navigate to the screen displayed above.
  
Step 2:
  ![2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c90c95ff-925f-4bea-986a-e4e34cb5a4a0)

  Enter the auction house; your screen should resemble the image shown above.
  
Step 3:
  ![3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08e226a3-e9ac-4190-a094-bd2d6e8ea241)

  Open the search function in the auction house and adjust the settings to your desired configuration.  

  For example, in the image above, I selected **Porsche** as the brand/make and **911 GT3 RS '19** as the model. I then set the **max buyout** to **1,000,000 CR** to try and snipe a Porsche 911 GT3 RS '19 at or below that price.  

  However, you can customize these settings based on your preferences, as the bot will work with any configuration.
  
Step 4:
  
  Confirm your search configuration and then back out of the search screen to return to the main auction house interface.

  After completing these steps, your screen should resemble something similar to the image shown above.
  
Step 5: 
  
Run the script and then click back into **Forza Horizon 5**. Move your cursor to a location where it won't accidentally select anything on the screen. If you have a second monitor, you can place it there, or alternatively, you can move it to the top-left corner of your screen.

**Important:** You must always have the game window active (clicked into) for the program to work. This is because the program simulates keyboard presses, functioning like a macro that makes decisions based on what it detects on your screen.

**WARNING:** This bot violates the Forza Code of Conduct, and as such, using it is at your own risk. Please be aware of the potential consequences.

Unless Forza Horizon 5 is able to detect unnaturally fast input of key presses, it is unlikely that this bot will be detected, and you should not be at risk of a ban. However, use it at your own discretion.
